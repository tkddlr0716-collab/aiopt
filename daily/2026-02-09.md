## Commit 6 verification attempt: PR annotations (SARIF)

- Created branch: `verify/pr-annotations`
- Added file: `pr-annotation-demo.js` (contains patterns intended to trigger SARIF findings)
- Opened PR: https://github.com/tkddlr0716-collab/aiopt/pull/1

Workflow runs (aiopt.yml):
- PR run: https://github.com/tkddlr0716-collab/aiopt/actions/runs/21828438963 (pull_request)
- Push run: https://github.com/tkddlr0716-collab/aiopt/actions/runs/21828435288 (push)

Observed status during this session:
- both runs remained **queued** for multiple minutes (no job execution yet).

Local deterministic proof:
- `aiopt scan` generates `aiopt-output/aiopt.sarif` always.
- `aiopt gate` blocks with exit 1 and <=10 lines if SARIF contains warning/error.
- `aiopt fix` generates `aiopt-output/aiopt.patch` and supports `--apply`.
